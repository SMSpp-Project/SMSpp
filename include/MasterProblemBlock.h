/** @file
 * Header file for the class MasterProblemBlock, which derives from Block to
 * implement, within the SMS++ framework, the Master Problem of a stabilized
 * method, i.e., the problem of minimizing a model made of linearizations plus
 * a stabilizing term.
 *
 * MasterProblemBlock represents and solves that Master Problem (MP) on a
 * sum-function
 *
 *     f( x ) = b * x + \sum_{ k \in K } f^k( x )
 *
 * where each component f^k is accessed either via a black-box oracle ("hard"
 * component) or has a known compact convex description ("easy" component, cf.
 * [Frangioni, Gorgone, MP 2014]).
 *
 * Two complementary formulations of the MP are supported, both directly
 * encoded as a Block structure (and therefore solvable by any Solver
 * registered to MasterProblemBlock, typically a [MILP]Solver):
 *
 * - the **primal** form reads
 *
 *      min   b * d + \sum_k v^k + (1/2t) || d ||^2_2
 *      s.t.  v^k >= g^k_i * d + alpha^k_i        for each i in B^k       (P)
 *            v^k >= LB^k
 *
 *   where d is the step from the current stability center x_bar, v^k is
 *   the epigraph variable for component k, and (g^k_i, alpha^k_i) are the
 *   linearizations stored in the bundle B^k;
 *
 * - the **dual** form reads
 *
 *      max   \sum_k \sum_i theta^k_i (c^k - x_bar A^k) u^k_i
 *            + x_bar z - (t/2) || z ||^2_2 - \sum_k \sum_i theta^k_i alpha^k_i
 *      s.t.  \sum_i theta^k_i + gamma^k = lambda          for each k     (D)
 *            z = b - \sum_k A^k ( \sum_i theta^k_i u^k_i )
 *            theta^k_i >= 0 ,  gamma^k >= 0 ,  lambda >= 0
 *
 *   plus the additional native u^k variables and constraints of any "easy"
 *   component k (its compact polyhedral description being directly inserted
 *   in the MP, rather than inner-approximated by extreme points).
 *
 * In both formulations:
 *
 * - one PolyhedralFunctionBlock is registered as a sub-Block of
 *   MasterProblemBlock for each "hard" component, holding its bundle B^k
 *   (either in primal or in dual representation, consistently with the
 *   chosen MP form);
 *
 * - each "easy" component is registered as a sub-Block containing the
 *   compact convex description of f^k (typically a linear/convex program
 *   inherited from a LagBFunction);
 *
 * - the MasterProblemBlock itself owns the *coupling* part of the MP, i.e.,
 *   the static Variable and Constraint that glue the per-component sub-MPs
 *   together (lambda, r, omega, gamma^k, the coupling constraint on z,
 *   the level/global-LB rows, ...), and an FRealObjective with the
 *   stabilizing quadratic term plus the linear part.
 *
 * Three stabilization schemes are supported, selected via the
 * #stabilization_type enum:
 *
 * - **Proximal**: quadratic term (1/2t) || d ||^2_2 in (P), equivalently
 *   - (t/2) || z ||^2_2 in (D);
 *
 * - **Level**: an additional level constraint v <= f_lev together with a
 *   non-negative multiplier omega in the dual;
 *
 * - **Doubly-Stabilized**: combines both, see [Astorino, Frangioni,
 *   Fuduli, Gorgone, MP 2017].
 *
 * Following the SMS++ distinction between physical and abstract
 * representations, the physical representation of a MasterProblemBlock is the
 * compact state that characterizes the current master problem: the registered
 * sub-Blocks, the current stability center, and the stabilization parameters
 * (the proximal parameter t, the level value Lvl and the selected
 * stabilization type). The Variable, Constraint and Objective objects forming
 * the primal or dual MP are the corresponding abstract representation
 * generated from that physical state.
 *
 * MasterProblemBlock is meant to be driven by a solver, which is responsible
 * for keeping the sets B^k of linearizations updated as its algorithm
 * proceeds and for reading the solution of the MP; the class makes no
 * assumption on what that algorithm is, a bundle method and a conditional
 * gradient method using the very same object for different purposes. The
 * driver does *not* directly call any MILP backend, it only manipulates the
 * MP at the Block/Modification level and triggers compute() on the
 * [MILP]Solver attached to the MasterProblemBlock.

/// A Block representing the Master Problem of a stabilized method
/** MasterProblemBlock implements, as an SMS++ Block, the Master Problem (MP)
 * of a stabilized method, the Generalized Bundle Method being the one its
 * formulations come from (cf. \link MasterProblemBlock.h \endlink for
 * the mathematical description of the supported primal and dual forms, and for
 * the underlying references).
 *
 * The Block exposes the coupling part of the MP (the static Variable and
 * Constraint linking together the per-component bundles, plus the stabilizing
 * quadratic Objective), while each component f^k is represented by a dedicated
 * sub-Block:
 *
 * - "hard" components -> a PolyhedralFunctionBlock holding the bundle B^k
 *   (in the same primal/dual representation as the master);
 *
 * - "easy" components -> a sub-Block containing the compact convex
 *   description of f^k (e.g. inherited from a LagBFunction).
 *
 * A regular Solver (typically a [MILP]Solver from the SMS++ MILPSolver module)
 * is attached to MasterProblemBlock through register_Solver(), and is then
 * asked to solve the MP at every iteration of whoever drives it.
 *
 * That Solver is asked for something rather more specific than an optimal
 * value, which puts two demands on how it is configured. It has to re-optimise
 * from the basis of the previous call, a handful of new columns at a time, so
 * it has to be an active-set method: an interior point one cannot restart, and
 * its multipliers, which here *are* the algorithm rather than a by-product,
 * are only accurate to about 1e-7 relative, which the stopping test of the
 * Bundle does not survive. And it has to satisfy the rows of the MP more
 * tightly than the oracle satisfies its own: a step that violates a row by
 * less than the accuracy the oracle works at is feasible for the MP and
 * infeasible for the component, which answers with the cut that is already
 * there, and the iteration repeats forever. Hence the feasibility and
 * optimality tolerances of the Solver go well below the accuracy the Bundle is
 * asked to reach. */

  * point. This is the API the surrounding driver /
  * BendersDecompositionSolver uses to populate MasterProblemBlock with
  * everything it needs.
  *
  * MasterProblemBlock never sees the "hard" components directly: only
  * their number (\p num_hard_cmps) is fed in, since their bundles B^k
  * are built up internally as empty PolyhedralFunctionBlock(s) under
  * *this* and populated by the surrounding bundle driver
  * through the add_cut() / remove_cut() interface. The "easy" components
  * are passed in via \p easy_components, type-dispatched (LagBFunction,
  * BendersBFunction, ...) and absorbed into the master in the form
  * dictated by the requested primal / dual MP. The dualization details
  * stay inside MasterProblemBlock, so callers only need to know which
  * components are easy.
  *
  * For both a LagBFunction in the dual MP and a BendersBFunction in the primal
  * MP, the inner Block is registered in the MasterProblemBlock sub-Block list
  * and has this MasterProblemBlock as father, but it is deliberately not
  * removed from the Function Block's own sub-Block list. The Function Block
  * therefore retains ownership and direct access, while modifications from
  * the inner Block propagate through MasterProblemBlock. The latter intercepts
  * them in add_Modification(), notifies the retained Function Block owner and
  * then forwards them normally along the master Block tree.
  *
  * The optional \p ignored_blocks list is forwarded to the inner Solver
  * via Solver::set_excluded_blocks(), telling it which registered
  * sub-Block subtrees have to be skipped.

  *
  * This override restores the logical two-way dispatch: each Modification from

  * owner, allowing it to update its caches and issue the corresponding
  * Function Modification; the original Modification is then passed to

  * configured, so a nonzero channel valid on the master branch is not
  * necessarily valid on the owner's original branch. An already-formed
  * homogeneous GroupModification is preserved; a group spanning different easy
  * owners or mixing easy and non-easy origins is recursively split only for
  * owner notification. The original group remains unchanged on the master
